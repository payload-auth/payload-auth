# Admin Invitations

Admin invitations are a feature that allows you to invite users to the admin panel. This is useful for teams that want to control access to the admin panel.

## How to use admin invitations

To use admin invitations, you need to enable the `adminInvitations` option in the `auth` configuration.

```ts
export default defineConfig({
  auth: {
    adminInvitations: true,
  },
});
```

This will enable the admin invitations feature and allow you to invite users to the admin panel.

## How to invite users to the admin panel

To invite users to the admin panel, you need to use the `inviteUser` function.

```ts
const user = await inviteUser({
  email: 'test@example.com',
  role: 'admin',
});
```

This will invite a user to the admin panel with the `admin` role.

## How to accept an invitation

To accept an invitation, you need to use the `acceptInvitation` function.



```ts
const user = await acceptInvitation({
  email: 'test@example.com',
  password: 'password',
});
```

This will accept the invitation and log the user in.

## How to verify an invitation

To verify an invitation, you need to use the `verifyInvitation` function.



```ts
const user = await verifyInvitation({
  email: 'test@example.com',
  token: 'token',
});
```

This will verify the invitation and return the user.

## How to revoke an invitation

To revoke an invitation, you need to use the `revokeInvitation` function.



```ts
const user = await revokeInvitation({
  email: 'test@example.com',
});
```
