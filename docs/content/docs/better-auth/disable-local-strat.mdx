# Disable Local Strategy

By default, Better Auth will use the local strategy for authentication. However, you can disable the local strategy by setting the `disableLocalStrategy` option to `true`.

```ts
export default defineConfig({
  auth: {
    disableLocalStrategy: true,
  },
});
```

This will disable the local strategy and only use the auth provider's strategy.

## Example

```ts
export default defineConfig({
  auth: { disableLocalStrategy: true },
});
```
